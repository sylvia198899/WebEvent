The code sample I provided is developed by C# when I worked at my previous company. The main code I would like to demonstrate is to buy the game points, which is in the folder of “BuyPoint”. I choose this to be code sample because this one contained lots of functions of my daily programming.The order pages of this project are “agreement”, “confirm”, “reconfirm”, and “complete.” The functions are as following.•	Agreement: This page is the agreement page contained the contract and gamers agreed to pay for buying the game points.•	Confirm: The functions of this page are getting the whole money the gamer have, and gamers have to choose the game server, character, and the amount of game points they want to exchange. (The structure is using the money which belongs my gaming company and can be used for all products (games), to exchange the game points which belongs the specific game.) (The game character data and game points are located on different server.)•	Reconfirm: This page is used to confirm the data from last page gamers choose, then deduct the money, exchange the game points, and write the record into database.•	Complete: This page shows the success message and gamers can choose to continue the exchange points process again.
